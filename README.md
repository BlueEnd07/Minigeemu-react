## Overview
This project is a collection of web games created as a collaborative effort by me and my friends for a college project. The games are built using React and Tailwind CSS framework.

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Minigeemu-react`
3. Install packages by running: `npm install` 
4. Run the server: `npm run dev`

## Games 🕹️

### 1. Box Runner 📦🏃
- In "Box Runner," your objective is to navigate through a challenging course filled with obstacles. Your character automatically moves forward, and your task is to jump or duck to avoid oncoming obstacles. Whether you're a casual gamer or a speed enthusiast, this game offers an adrenaline-pumping experience for players of all levels.

### 2. Dino Run 🦖🏃
- Similar to Box Runner, but instead of a box, you are a Dino. A bit easier than Box Runner.

### 3. Rock-Paper-Scissors ✊🤚✌️
- This is the classic Rock Paper Scissor game, where you play with the CPU. In this game, you can select between different choices (Rock, Paper, and Scissor), and the CPU selects a random choice between the given options.
